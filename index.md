I am a Researcher at TCS Research and a part-time PhD student at IIT Madras.  
My work spans control systems, reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, game theory,  
and optimization. I develop algorithms for dynamical systems, trajectory optimization,  
and learning in multi-agent environments.

My research has been published in IJCAI, CDC, and MED.  
I am broadly interested in AI for dynamical systems and decision-making.
