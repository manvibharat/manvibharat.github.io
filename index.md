I am an Applied Research Engineer at TCS Research, with a background in control systems and machine learning.  
My work focuses on designing and implementing learning-based algorithms for multi-agent systems, decision-making, and optimization.

Recently, I have been working on end-to-end perception and efficiency-oriented machine learning systems, including Bird’s-Eye-View (BEV) perception pipelines, Vision Transformers, and model optimization for latency-constrained inference.

I have published research in venues including IJCAI, CDC, and MED.  
Selected projects and technical work are listed below.
