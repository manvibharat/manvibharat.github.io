### **MS Thesis: Formation Control and Trajectory Tracking**
- Developed a two-level nonlinear control strategy for a leader–follower formation to maintain a rigid regular-polygon geometry while tracking smooth trajectories.
- Simulated the control law and demonstrated that trajectory tracking error and formation orientation error converge to zero (MED 2021).
- Built a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) setup as part of the thesis to test the proposed control law (from MED 2021) on quadrotors.

### **IJCAI 2024: Optimizing Prosumer Policies in Periodic Double Auctions**
- Modeled a periodic double auction as a Markov game with prosumers capable of both buying and small-scale selling.
- Derived equilibrium bidding strategies and analyzed their impact on procurement cost and market outcomes.
- Evaluated the proposed policy in the PowerTAC energy market simulator and compared it against state-of-the-art bidding strategies.

### **PhD Research: Learning Equilibria via Better-Response Dynamics**
- Developed a Python-based multi-agent energy market simulator to study strategic interactions among energy brokers.
- Designed and analyzed better-response dynamics within this environment, including preliminary results on convergence toward equilibrium behavior.
- Implemented multi-agent learning strategies inspired by better-response dynamics and evaluated them against baseline policies in the simulator.
