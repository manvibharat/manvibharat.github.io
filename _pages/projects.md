Below are selected research projects aligned with my current interests in  
control, reinforcement learning, trajectory optimization, and multi-agent systems.

### Geometric Control on SO(3) with Hardware-in-the-Loop Validation  
**MS Thesis, IIT Madras**

Implemented geometric attitude control laws on the Lie group SO(3) using Julia  
and DifferentialEquations.jl. Developed a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) setup for  
evaluating real-time behavior, stability, and noise robustness of quadrotor-style  
rotational dynamics.

### Curvature-Adaptive Trajectory Optimization for Quadrotors  
Designed curvature-aware and spline-based trajectory generation strategies for  
smooth 3D paths. Developed waypoint pruning, smoothing, and online replanning  
methods to reduce oscillations and improve tracking accuracy.

### Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework (MADDPG)  
Built a custom PyTorch implementation of the MADDPG algorithm with decentralized  
actors and a centralized critic. Investigated critic–actor stability, exploration  
noise scaling, and convergence in continuous multi-agent environments.

### Game-Theoretic Best-Response Dynamics Simulator (PhD Work)  
Developing simulation tools for analyzing $\varepsilon$-best-response dynamics,  
stability, and cyclical behavior in multi-agent games. Part of my ongoing  
PhD research in dynamic games at IIT Madras.
