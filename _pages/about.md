I am a Researcher at TCS Research and a part-time PhD student at IIT Madras.  
My work spans control systems, reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, game theory,  
and optimization. I develop algorithms for dynamical systems, trajectory optimization,  
and learning in multi-agent environments.

My research has been published in IJCAI, CDC, and MED.  
I am broadly interested in AI for dynamical systems and decision-making.

I enjoy working at the intersection of machine learning, control theory, and optimization,  
designing systems that combine data-driven learning with mathematical structure.


I am Bharat Manvi. I have completed MS by Research in Control and Optimization group of Electrical Engineering at IIT Madras.
My research was on establishing Lyapuanov Stability of the **Cascade of Formation and Geometric Control**[^1]. 

Currently I am working at TCS Research and my research is in the area of Game theory and Auctions.  More specifically, my research interests lies in the intersection of multi-agent system and game theory. Recent success of MARL algorithms in MAS has fascinated me about using game theoretical modelling in MARL algorithms. I feel, my current research of finding Nash Equilibria in abstract games might help in reasoning the MARL solutions. My current research lead to following papers on finding Nash Equilibria in Periodic Double Auctions.

- [Optimizing Prosumer Policies in Periodic Double Auctions Inspired by Equilibrium Analysis](https://manvibharat.github.io/publication/IJCAI2024)
 
As on 2024, I joined as a PhD student in IIT Madras Electricity Department and I will be working on **game theory** and its applications in **RL and Multi agent RL**.  

## My Research Topics
