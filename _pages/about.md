I am Bharat Manvi. I completed my MS degree in Electrical Engineering; Control and optimization group; in IIT Madras.
I did my research in Lyapunov stability analysis of the cascade of formation and geometric control. Currently I am working at TCS Research and my research is in area of Electricity Wholesale market. 

More specifically, I research in intersection of multi-agent system and game theory. Recently, I got interest in learning algorithms, using Multi agent RL and applying game theory in analysing the algorithms using game theoy. As on 2024, I joined as a PhD student in IIT Madras Electricity Department and my work will on game theory and its applications in RL and Multi agent RL. I will be still be employed at TCS research. Please free to contact me at **manvibharat123@gmail.com** to discuss research topics.

<!-- I am fascinated by the possibilities of learning and control in many of the applications. -->
