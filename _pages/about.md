I am an Applied Research Engineer at TCS Research with a background in control systems and machine learning. My work spans learning-based methods for multi-agent systems, with publications in IJCAI and CDC.
Recently, I have focused on vision-based perception and efficient deep learning systems, building end-to-end Bird’s-Eye-View (BEV) perception pipelines from multi-camera inputs and exploring model optimization techniques such as post-training quantization for deployment efficiency. I enjoy working at the intersection of geometry, learning, and systems, particularly where accuracy–latency trade-offs matter.
I am pursuing a part-time PhD at IIT Madras, where my research explores learning dynamics and equilibrium-seeking algorithms in multi-agent settings. Alongside research, I enjoy implementing ideas in PyTorch and evaluating models with a systems perspective.
