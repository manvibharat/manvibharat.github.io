Auctions Inspired by Equilibrium Analysis"

excerpt: 'We consider a periodic double auction (PDA)
wherein the main participants are wholesale sup-
pliers and brokers representing retailers. The sup-
pliers are represented by a composite supply curve
and the brokers are represented by individual bids.
Additionally, the brokers can participate in small-
scale selling by placing individual asks; hence, they
act as prosumers. Specifically, in a PDA, the pro-
sumers who are net buyers have multiple opportu-
nities to buy or sell multiple units of a commod-
ity with the aim of minimizing the cost of buy-
ing across multiple rounds of the PDA. Formu-
lating optimal bidding strategies for such a PDA
setting involves planning across current and future
rounds while considering the bidding strategies of
other agents. In this work, we propose Markov
perfect Nash equilibrium (MPNE) policies for a
setup where multiple prosumers with knowledge
of the composite supply curve compete to procure
commodities. Thereafter, the MPNE policies are
used to develop an algorithm called MPNE-BBS
for the case wherein the prosumers need to re-
construct an approximate composite supply curve
using past auction information. The efficacy of the
proposed algorithm is demonstrated on the Pow-
erTAC wholesale market simulator against several
baselines and state-of-the-art bidding policies.'
