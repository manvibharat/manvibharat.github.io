excerpt: 'â€” We consider a periodic double auction (PDA)
setting where buyers of the auction have multiple (but finite)
opportunities to procure multiple but fixed units of a commodity. The goal of each buyer participating in such auctions is to
reduce their cost of procurement by planning their purchase
across multiple rounds of the PDA. Formulating such optimal
bidding strategies in a multi-agent periodic double auction
setting is a challenging problem as such strategies involve
planning across current and future auctions. In this work, we
consider one such setup wherein the composite supply curve is
known to all buyers. Specifically, for the complete information
setting, we model the PDA as a Markov game and derive
Markov perfect Nash equilibrium (MPNE) solution to devise
an optimal bidding strategy for the case when each buyer is
allowed to make one bid per round of the PDA. Thereafter,
the efficacy of the Nash policies obtained is demonstrated with
numerical experiments.'
